# 1.1.3 Availability and Reliability: The Uptime Guarantee

## Intuitive Explanation

Imagine you are ordering a pizza:

- **Reliability:** Can the delivery company actually deliver the pizza in a storm, 99 times out of 100? (The system
  consistently works as expected, even under stress.)
- **Availability:** Is the delivery company's phone number always reachable, even if they sometimes tell you the wait
  time is 3 hours? (The system is operational and accessible when requested.)

Reliability is about correctness over time; Availability is about accessibility at a given time.

## In-Depth Analysis

### Availability (The Nines)

Availability is measured as the percentage of time a system is fully operational. It is commonly referred to by the
number of "nines."

| Availability         | Downtime Per Year | Terminology                            |
|----------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 99.0% (Two Nines)    | 3.65 days         | Unacceptable for critical services.    |
| 99.9% (Three Nines)  | ~8.76 hours       | Common goal for non-critical services. |
| 99.99% (Four Nines)  | ‚àº52.6 minutes     | High Availability (HA) standard.       |
| 99.999% (Five Nines) | ‚àº5.26 minutes     | Required for mission-critical systems. |

### Reliability and Fault Tolerance

- **Reliability:** The probability that a system will perform its intended function for a specified time under stated
  conditions.
- **Fault Tolerance:** The ability of a system to continue operating without interruption when one or more of its
  components fail.
- **Redundancy (N+1):** The core mechanism for achieving fault tolerance. It means having backup components ready to
  take over. An N+1 setup means you need N servers to handle peak load but have N+1 servers deployed.

### Key Concepts / Tradeoffs

|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Single Point of Failure (SPOF) | Any single component whose failure will cause the entire system or a critical section of it to stop working. Must be eliminated in HLD. | Eliminating SPOF requires duplicating hardware/software (redundancy), which increases cost and complexity.                |
| Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)     | The average time it takes to fix a failed component and bring it back online. High availability depends on low MTTR.                    | Prioritizing low MTTR requires significant investment in DevOps automation (auto-healing, rapid deployment).              |
| Multi-Region Deployment        | Deploying the entire system across multiple, geographically distant data centers (e.g., East Coast and West Coast).                     | Solves region-wide disasters (earthquakes, power grids) but adds significant latency to data replication between regions. |

## üí° Real-World Use Cases

- **Google Search (Five Nines):** Requires near-perfect availability; any downtime results in massive lost revenue and
  user impact. Achieved through massive redundancy and multi-region deployment.
- **Load Balancers:** Serve as a fault-tolerance mechanism by redirecting traffic away from unhealthy servers, ensuring
  the system remains available.
- **Database Replication:** A critical reliability technique where data is copied to multiple slave/follower nodes. If
  the primary node fails, a replica can be promoted to master.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Design Challenge

Your product manager demands "Five Nines" (99.999%) availability for your new user authentication service. Explain why
this is almost impossible to guarantee and detail two architecture components you would prioritize to get as close as
possible.
