## 1. Duplicate Detection: Bloom Filter + Redis vs Pure Redis vs Pure Database

### The Problem

**Challenge:** With 10 billion URLs to crawl, we need to check if each URL has already been crawled to avoid redundant work. Every crawl decision requires a duplicate check.

**Constraints:**
- 10 billion unique URLs need to be tracked
- Duplicate check must be < 10ms to avoid bottleneck (1,000 QPS)
- False positives are acceptable (crawling same page twice)
- False negatives are NOT acceptable (missing new pages)
- Cost must be reasonable

### Options Considered

| Approach | Memory | Lookup Time | False Positive Rate | Cost/month | Pros | Cons |
|----------|--------|-------------|---------------------|------------|------|------|
| **Bloom Filter + Redis** | 12 GB (Bloom)<br/>+ 500 GB (Redis) | ~1ms | 1% | $500 | 99% memory savings, Fast | 1% FP, Complexity |
| **Pure Redis (Set)** | 5 TB | ~1ms | 0% | $50,000 | No false positives, Simple | 100x cost, Memory intensive |
| **PostgreSQL** | 1 TB (with index) | ~10-50ms | 0% | $5,000 | ACID, Query flexibility | Too slow, Not scalable |
| **Cassandra** | 2 TB (with bloom) | ~5-10ms | 0% | $2,000 | Scalable, Fast writes | Still expensive, Over-engineered |

**Cost Calculation:**
- **Bloom Filter:** 12 GB RAM @ $0.05/GB/hour = $432/month
- **Redis (500 GB):** $0.10/GB/hour = $3,600/month → **Total: $4,032/month**
- **Pure Redis (5 TB):** $0.10/GB/hour = $36,000/month
- **PostgreSQL:** r5.4xlarge (128 GB) = $5,000/month
- **Cassandra:** 10 nodes × $200 = $2,000/month

### Decision Made

**✅ Bloom Filter (Tier 1) + Redis (Tier 2)**

**Implementation:**
```
function is_duplicate(url):
  // Tier 1: Bloom Filter (99% rejection rate)
  if not bloom_filter.contains(url):
    return False  // Definitely not duplicate
  
  // Tier 2: Redis confirmation (1% of cases)
  if redis.exists(hash(url)):
    return True  // Confirmed duplicate
  
  return False  // False positive
```

### Rationale

1. **99% memory savings** vs pure Redis ($4k vs $36k/month)
2. **Sub-millisecond lookups:** Bloom Filter rejects 99% instantly
3. **100% accuracy** when Redis confirms (no missed URLs)
4. **Acceptable false positive rate:** 1% of URLs crawled twice is tolerable
5. **Proven at scale:** Used by Google, Common Crawl

### Trade-offs Accepted

| Trade-off | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **1% false positives** | Crawl ~100M pages twice | Acceptable (bandwidth is cheap) |
| **System complexity** | Two-tier system to maintain | Worth the 90% cost savings |
| **Rebuild required** | Bloom Filter needs periodic rebuild | Automate with blue-green deployment |
| **No delete support** | Can't remove URLs from Bloom Filter | Use Redis as source of truth |

### When to Reconsider

**Switch to Pure Redis if:**
- Scale drops below 1B URLs (cost becomes comparable)
- False positives become unacceptable (e.g., paid API calls)
- Budget increases 10x (can afford $36k/month)

**Switch to Cassandra if:**
- Need complex queries on crawl history
- Want to store additional metadata per URL
- Need multi-datacenter replication (geo-redundancy)

---

## 2. URL Queue: Kafka vs SQS vs RabbitMQ vs Database

### The Problem

**Challenge:** Maintain a queue of billions of URLs to crawl, support priority, handle backpressure, and ensure no URLs are lost if workers crash.

**Constraints:**
- Must handle 1,000 QPS of URL additions (from link extraction)
- Must support priority (seed URLs should be crawled first)
- Must be fault-tolerant (no data loss if workers crash)
- Must scale to billions of URLs

### Options Considered

| Feature | Kafka | AWS SQS | RabbitMQ | PostgreSQL | Redis Queue |
|---------|-------|---------|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Throughput** | 100k+ msgs/sec | 3k msgs/sec | 50k msgs/sec | 1k writes/sec | 100k msgs/sec |
| **Durability** | ✅ Replicated | ✅ Managed | ✅ Replicated | ✅ ACID | ❌ In-memory |
| **Priority Support** | ✅ Topics | ❌ Limited | ✅ Native | ✅ ORDER BY | ✅ ZSET |
| **Backpressure** | ✅ Partition lag | ❌ None | ⚠️ Limited | ❌ None | ❌ None |
| **Cost (10B msgs)** | $2,000 | $4,000 | $3,000 | $10,000 | $1,000 |
| **Operational** | Medium | Low (managed) | High | Medium | Low |

### Decision Made

**✅ Kafka (with multiple topics for priority)**

**Architecture:**
```
Kafka Cluster:
├── Topic: frontier-high (10 partitions) → 70% of workers
├── Topic: frontier-medium (20 partitions) → 20% of workers
└── Topic: frontier-low (40 partitions) → 10% of workers

Partitioning: By domain hash (all URLs from same domain → same partition)
```

### Rationale

1. **High throughput:** 100k+ msgs/sec (far exceeds our 1,000 QPS)
2. **Fault tolerance:** Kafka replicates data across brokers (no data loss)
3. **Priority support:** Multiple topics for high/medium/low priority
4. **Backpressure:** Kafka buffers URLs if workers are slow
5. **Consumer groups:** Multiple workers consume from same topic (parallel processing)
6. **Partitioning:** Domain-based partitioning aids politeness enforcement

### Trade-offs Accepted

| Trade-off | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Operational complexity** | Requires Kafka cluster maintenance | Use managed Kafka (MSK, Confluent Cloud) |
| **Cost** | $2,000/month for cluster | Cheaper than SQS ($4k) or database ($10k) |
| **Ordering** | No global order (only per-partition) | Acceptable (domain-level ordering is enough) |
| **Latency** | ~10-50ms per message | Acceptable for batch processing |

### When to Reconsider

**Switch to SQS if:**
- Throughput drops below 3k QPS (SQS limit)
- Want fully managed service (no ops burden)
- Cost becomes less critical

**Switch to RabbitMQ if:**
- Need complex routing (topic exchanges, headers)
- Want native priority queues
- Operating on-premise (not cloud)

**Switch to PostgreSQL if:**
- Scale drops below 1M URLs (can fit in single DB)
- Need complex queries on queue state
- Want ACID guarantees

---

## 3. Politeness Enforcement: Distributed Locks vs Worker Assignment vs No Politeness

### The Problem

**Challenge:** Prevent multiple workers from overwhelming a single domain with concurrent requests, which would:
- Overload the target server (DDoS-like behavior)
- Get the crawler's IP banned/blacklisted
- Violate `Crawl-delay` directive in robots.txt

**Constraints:**
- 10-20 workers fetching URLs concurrently
- Same domain might appear in multiple Kafka partitions
- Must enforce 1 req/sec rate limit per domain

### Options Considered

| Approach | Concurrency Control | Rate Limit Accuracy | Complexity | Failure Mode |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|------------|--------------|
| **Distributed Locks (Redis)** | ✅ Perfect | ✅ Exact (Token Bucket) | Medium | Lock lost → Safe (TTL) |
| **Sticky Worker Assignment** | ⚠️ Good (if balanced) | ✅ Exact | Low | Worker crash → Rebalance delay |
| **No Politeness** | ❌ None | ❌ None | None | IP ban, lawsuits |
| **Centralized Coordinator** | ✅ Perfect | ✅ Exact | High | SPOF, bottleneck |

### Decision Made

**✅ Distributed Locks (Redis) + Local Cache**

**Implementation:**
```
function fetch_with_politeness(url):
  domain = extract_domain(url)
  
  // Check local cache (99% hit rate)
  if cache.has_lock(domain):
    fetch(url)
    return
  
  // Acquire distributed lock (1% of cases)
  if redis.set(f"lock:{domain}", worker_id, NX, EX=10):
    cache.add_lock(domain)
    fetch(url)
    redis.del(f"lock:{domain}")
  else:
    sleep(1)  // Another worker has lock
    retry()
```

### Rationale

1. **Perfect concurrency control:** Only one worker per domain at a time
2. **No SPOF:** Redis is replicated, no single point of failure
3. **Deadlock prevention:** TTL (10s) ensures locks are released
4. **Local cache optimization:** 99% of lock checks hit in-memory cache
5. **Simple to understand:** Clear semantics for engineers

### Trade-offs Accepted

| Trade-off | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **5-10ms latency per lock** | Slows down fetching | Local cache reduces to ~1ms |
| **Redis dependency** | Crawler stops if Redis fails | Redis replication (99.9% uptime) |
| **Lock contention** | Workers wait for popular domains | Increase worker count |
| **Not 100% accurate** | Clock skew between workers | NTP synchronization |

### When to Reconsider

**Switch to Sticky Worker Assignment if:**
- Have fewer workers (< 5) where assignment is stable
- Can tolerate load imbalance
- Want to minimize Redis dependency

**Switch to Centralized Coordinator if:**
- Need 100% perfect rate limiting
- Can tolerate single point of failure
- Have dedicated ops team

**Never use No Politeness** (ethical and legal violations)

## 4. Crawl Strategy: Asynchronous vs Multi-threaded vs Single-threaded

### The Problem

**Challenge:** Maximize URL fetch throughput while minimizing resource usage (CPU, memory).

**Constraints:**
- Must achieve 1,000 QPS with 10-20 workers
- Average fetch time: 500ms (dominated by network I/O)
- Each worker: Limited CPU, memory

### Options Considered

| Approach | Throughput/Worker | CPU Usage | Memory Usage | Complexity |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| **Async I/O (aiohttp/Go)** | 200 URLs/sec | 20% | 2 GB | Medium |
| **Multi-threaded (100 threads)** | 100 URLs/sec | 50% | 5 GB | High |
| **Single-threaded** | 2 URLs/sec | 10% | 500 MB | Low |
| **Process pool (10 processes)** | 20 URLs/sec | 60% | 10 GB | Medium |

**Throughput Calculation:**
```
Async I/O:
- 100 concurrent requests per worker
- Avg fetch time: 500ms
- Throughput: 100 / 0.5s = 200 URLs/sec/worker
- For 1,000 QPS: 1,000 / 200 = 5 workers needed

Single-threaded:
- 1 request at a time
- Avg fetch time: 500ms
- Throughput: 1 / 0.5s = 2 URLs/sec/worker
- For 1,000 QPS: 1,000 / 2 = 500 workers needed 😱
```

### Decision Made

**✅ Asynchronous I/O (Python aiohttp / Go goroutines)**

**Implementation:**
```python
# Python example
async def crawl_worker():
  while True:
    urls = await kafka.consume_batch(100)
    tasks = [fetch_url_async(url) for url in urls]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    await process_results(results)
```

### Rationale

1. **100x throughput** vs single-threaded (200 vs 2 URLs/sec)
2. **Low CPU usage:** 80% time spent waiting for I/O (not CPU)
3. **Memory efficient:** 2 GB vs 5 GB (multi-threaded) or 10 GB (process pool)
4. **Simple error handling:** Each async task has isolated exception handling
5. **Proven at scale:** Used by Scrapy, httpx, modern web frameworks

### Trade-offs Accepted

| Trade-off | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Complexity** | Requires understanding async/await | Good documentation, type hints |
| **Debugging** | Stack traces harder to read | Use async-aware debuggers |
| **Library support** | Not all libraries support async | Use aiohttp, asyncio-compatible libs |
| **GIL (Python)** | Single-threaded CPU work | Use Go if CPU-bound (rare for I/O crawler) |

### When to Reconsider

**Switch to Multi-threaded if:**
- Using language without async support (Java pre-21)
- CPU-bound parsing (image processing, OCR)
- Team has no async experience

**Switch to Single-threaded if:**
- Crawling < 10 URLs/sec (hobby project)
- Running on resource-constrained device
- Want simplest possible implementation

**Never use Process Pool** (too memory-intensive for I/O-bound work)

## 5. Storage: S3 + Elasticsearch vs Pure Database vs Pure S3

### The Problem

**Challenge:** Store 10 billion web pages (raw HTML + parsed text) in a cost-effective, searchable manner.

**Constraints:**
- Raw HTML: 10B × 10 KB = 100 TB
- Parsed text: 10B × 3 KB (compressed) = 30 TB
- Must support full-text search
- Must be cost-effective

### Options Considered

| Approach | Storage Cost | Search Speed | Query Flexibility | Scalability |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **S3 + Elasticsearch** | $2,300 (S3)<br/>+ $3,000 (ES)<br/>= $5,300/month | <100ms | ✅ Full-text | ✅ Horizontal |
| **Pure PostgreSQL** | $10,000/month | ~1-5s | ✅ SQL | ⚠️ Vertical |
| **Pure S3 (Athena)** | $2,300/month | 10-60s | ⚠️ SQL | ✅ Horizontal |
| **Pure Elasticsearch** | $13,000/month | <100ms | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Horizontal |

**Cost Breakdown:**
```
S3:
- 100 TB × $0.023/GB/month = $2,300/month
- GET requests: 1M/month × $0.0004 = $0.40

Elasticsearch:
- 30 TB × $0.10/GB/month = $3,000/month
- 3 nodes × $500 (r5.xlarge) = $1,500/month
- Total: ~$4,500/month (with overhead)

PostgreSQL:
- 130 TB storage = r5.24xlarge ($10,000/month)
- Limited full-text search performance
```

### Decision Made

**✅ S3 (Raw HTML) + Elasticsearch (Parsed Text)**

**Architecture:**
```
Parser Output:
├── Raw HTML → S3 (100 TB, $2,300/month)
│   └── Partitioned by date: s3://bucket/2025-01-15/page123.html.gz
└── Parsed Text → Elasticsearch (30 TB, $4,500/month)
    └── Index: pages {url, title, content, timestamp, domain}

Total cost: $6,800/month
```

### Rationale

1. **Cost-effective:** $6.8k vs $10k (PostgreSQL) or $13k (pure ES)
2. **Fast search:** Elasticsearch provides sub-100ms full-text search
3. **Archival:** S3 is cheapest for cold storage (raw HTML rarely accessed)
4. **Scalability:** Both S3 and ES scale horizontally
5. **Separation of concerns:** Optimized storage for each data type

### Trade-offs Accepted

| Trade-off | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Two storage systems** | Operational complexity | Use managed services (AWS ES, S3) |
| **No ACID across both** | Can't do atomic updates | Acceptable (eventual consistency OK) |
| **ES cost** | $4.5k/month for search | Cheaper than alternatives |
| **S3 retrieval time** | ~100-500ms per file | Acceptable (rarely accessed) |

### When to Reconsider

**Switch to Pure PostgreSQL if:**
- Scale drops below 1 TB (can fit in single DB)
- Need complex relational queries
- Budget increases (can afford $10k/month)

**Switch to Pure S3 + Athena if:**
- Search speed > 10s is acceptable
- Want minimal cost ($2.3k/month)
- Queries are infrequent (batch analytics)

**Switch to Pure Elasticsearch if:**
- Need real-time analytics
- Search is primary use case
- Budget allows $13k/month

## 6. Rate Limiting: Token Bucket vs Leaky Bucket vs Fixed Window

### The Problem

**Challenge:** Enforce rate limit of 1 req/sec per domain while allowing short bursts.

**Constraints:**
- Default: 1 req/sec per domain
- Must allow bursts (e.g., 10 requests immediately if domain hasn't been accessed recently)
- Must prevent sustained overload

### Options Considered

| Algorithm | Burst Support | Smoothness | Complexity | Memory |
|-----------|---------------|------------|------------|--------|
| **Token Bucket** | ✅ Yes (10 tokens) | ⚠️ Bursty | Medium | 100 bytes/domain |
| **Leaky Bucket** | ❌ No | ✅ Smooth | Medium | 100 bytes/domain |
| **Fixed Window** | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ Spiky | Low | 50 bytes/domain |
| **Sliding Window** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Smooth | High | 200 bytes/domain |

**Example:**
```
Token Bucket (1 req/sec, burst=10):
- Time 0: 10 tokens available
- Requests 1-10: Consume 10 tokens (all succeed immediately)
- Request 11: No tokens, wait 1 second
- Time 1: 1 token refilled, request 11 succeeds

Leaky Bucket (1 req/sec, no burst):
- Time 0: Empty bucket
- Request 1: Add to bucket, process at 1 req/sec
- Requests 2-10: Add to bucket (queued)
- Process smoothly at 1 req/sec (no bursts)
```

### Decision Made

**✅ Token Bucket**

**Implementation:**
```python
class TokenBucket:
  def __init__(self, rate=1, capacity=10):
    self.rate = rate  # tokens/sec
    self.capacity = capacity
    self.tokens = capacity
    self.last_refill = time.time()
  
  def consume(self, tokens=1):
    self.refill()
    if self.tokens >= tokens:
      self.tokens -= tokens
      return True
    return False
  
  def refill(self):
    now = time.time()
    elapsed = now - self.last_refill
    new_tokens = elapsed * self.rate
    self.tokens = min(self.capacity, self.tokens + new_tokens)
    self.last_refill = now
```

### Rationale

1. **Burst support:** Allows 10 immediate requests if domain hasn't been accessed recently
2. **User-friendly:** Good user experience (fast initial responses)
3. **Simple to implement:** Single Redis data structure per domain
4. **Industry standard:** Used by AWS, Google Cloud, rate limiting libraries
5. **Configurable:** Easy to adjust rate and burst capacity per domain

### Trade-offs Accepted

| Trade-off | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Bursty traffic** | Target server sees spikes | Acceptable (10 requests over 500ms) |
| **Not perfectly smooth** | Occasional burst of 10 requests | Most servers can handle this |
| **Redis dependency** | Requires Redis for state | Redis is already used for locks |

### When to Reconsider

**Switch to Leaky Bucket if:**
- Need perfectly smooth traffic (no bursts)
- Target servers are extremely sensitive
- Regulatory requirement for constant rate

**Switch to Fixed Window if:**
- Want simplest possible implementation
- Burst spikes are acceptable
- Memory is extremely constrained

**Switch to Sliding Window if:**
- Need burst support + smooth traffic
- Can tolerate higher complexity
- Have extra memory budget

## 7. JavaScript Rendering: Headless Browser vs Static Parser vs No JS

### The Problem

**Challenge:** Modern websites use JavaScript (React, Angular, Vue) to render content. Static HTML parsers miss this content.

**Constraints:**
- ~30% of websites use JavaScript heavily
- Headless browser is 10-20x slower (2-10 seconds vs 100ms)
- Budget for infrastructure

### Options Considered

| Approach | Coverage | Speed | Cost/page | Complexity |
|----------|----------|-------|-----------|------------|
| **Headless Browser (All)** | 100% | 2-10s | $0.001 | High |
| **Headless Browser (Selective)** | 95% | 100ms avg | $0.0001 | Medium |
| **Static Parser (No JS)** | 70% | 50ms | $0.00001 | Low |
| **Pre-rendering Service** | 100% | 500ms | $0.001 | Low |

**Cost Comparison:**
```
Scenario: 1,000,000 pages/day

All Headless Browser:
- 1M × $0.001 = $1,000/day = $30,000/month

Selective Headless Browser:
- 100k JS-heavy pages × $0.001 = $100/day
- 900k static pages × $0.00001 = $9/day
- Total: $3,300/month

Static Parser Only:
- 1M × $0.00001 = $10/day = $300/month
- But misses 30% of content
```

### Decision Made

**✅ Static Parser (Default) + Selective Headless Browser (Important Sites)**

**Implementation:**
```python
def fetch_and_parse(url):
  domain = extract_domain(url)
  
  if domain in JS_HEAVY_SITES:  # Wikipedia, news sites
    html = headless_browser.fetch(url)  # 2-10s
  else:
    html = static_fetcher.fetch(url)  # 100ms
  
  return parse_html(html)

JS_HEAVY_SITES = [
  "wikipedia.org",  # Dynamic content
  "reddit.com",     # SPA
  "twitter.com",    # Infinite scroll
  ...
]
```

### Rationale

1. **Cost-effective:** $3.3k vs $30k/month (90% savings)
2. **Fast for most pages:** 90% of pages use static HTML (100ms)
3. **Coverage for important sites:** Wikipedia, news sites get full rendering
4. **Prioritization:** Important pages justify higher cost
5. **Scalable:** Can add more domains to JS_HEAVY_SITES list over time

### Trade-offs Accepted

| Trade-off | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Misses JS content on unknown sites** | ~10% content loss | Acceptable for general crawl |
| **Selective rendering complexity** | Need to maintain JS_HEAVY_SITES list | Start small, expand gradually |
| **Headless browser cost** | $100/day for JS sites | Still 10x cheaper than rendering all |
| **Latency variance** | 100ms vs 5s | Acceptable (async processing) |

### When to Reconsider

**Switch to All Headless Browser if:**
- Need 100% content coverage
- Budget increases 10x
- Crawling < 100k pages/day (cost is low)

**Switch to Static Parser Only if:**
- Budget is extremely limited (<$500/month)
- Crawling academic/government sites (mostly static HTML)
- Content completeness < 70% is acceptable

**Switch to Pre-rendering Service if:**
- Want 100% coverage without ops burden
- Can afford $1,000/day ($30k/month)
- Don't want to maintain headless browser infrastructure

---

## 8. Priority Strategy: Multi-topic vs Single Queue vs No Priority

### The Problem

**Challenge:** Important pages (Wikipedia, news sites) should be crawled before deep links on obscure websites.

**Constraints:**
- 10 billion URLs to prioritize
- Must avoid starvation (low-priority URLs never crawled)
- Must be efficient (no complex priority queue operations)

### Options Considered

| Approach | Priority Levels | Starvation Risk | Complexity | Throughput |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|------------|
| **Multi-topic Kafka** | 3 (H/M/L) | ❌ No | Medium | 100k msgs/sec |
| **Redis Priority Queue (ZSET)** | Infinite | ⚠️ Yes | High | 10k msgs/sec |
| **Single FIFO Queue** | 1 (None) | N/A | Low | 100k msgs/sec |
| **Database (ORDER BY priority)** | Infinite | ❌ No | Medium | 1k msgs/sec |

### Decision Made

**✅ Multi-topic Kafka (3 priority levels)**

**Architecture:**
```
Kafka Topics:
├── frontier-high (10 partitions)    ← 70% of workers
│   └── Seed URLs, Wikipedia, News
├── frontier-medium (20 partitions)  ← 20% of workers
│   └── Links from high-priority pages
└── frontier-low (40 partitions)     ← 10% of workers
    └── Links from low-priority pages

Worker Allocation:
- 7 workers consume from high-priority
- 2 workers consume from medium-priority
- 1 worker consumes from low-priority
```

### Rationale

1. **No starvation:** All priority levels get processed (guaranteed by worker allocation)
2. **High throughput:** Kafka handles 100k+ msgs/sec (no bottleneck)
3. **Simple to understand:** Three clear priority levels (not infinite)
4. **Efficient:** No complex priority queue operations (just topic selection)
5. **Scalable:** Add more workers to any priority level independently

### Trade-offs Accepted

| Trade-off | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Only 3 priority levels** | Less granular than infinite priorities | Sufficient for most use cases |
| **Worker allocation overhead** | Need to manually allocate workers | Use auto-scaling based on lag |
| **Low-priority delay** | Low-priority URLs take days to crawl | Acceptable (not time-sensitive) |
| **Kafka topic overhead** | 3 topics instead of 1 | Minimal cost increase |

### When to Reconsider

**Switch to Redis Priority Queue (ZSET) if:**
- Need infinite priority levels (e.g., PageRank scores)
- Want dynamic priority updates (re-prioritize URLs)
- Scale drops below 1M URLs

**Switch to Single FIFO Queue if:**
- All URLs have equal priority (rare for web crawling)
- Want simplest possible implementation
- Crawling a closed set of URLs (no discovery)

**Switch to Database (ORDER BY) if:**
- Need complex priority logic (SQL queries)
- Scale drops below 100k URLs
- Want rich metadata per URL

---

## 9. Deployment: Multi-region vs Single Region

### The Problem

**Challenge:** Should we deploy crawlers in multiple regions (US, EU, Asia) or a single region?

**Constraints:**
- Target servers are distributed globally
- Network latency varies: 10ms (local) vs 200ms (cross-continent)
- Regulatory compliance (EU GDPR: data must stay in EU)

### Options Considered

| Approach | Latency | Cost | Compliance | Fault Tolerance |
|----------|---------|------|------------|-----------------|
| **Multi-region (3)** | 10-50ms | $20k/month | ✅ Yes | ✅ High |
| **Single region (US)** | 50-200ms | $7k/month | ❌ No | ⚠️ Medium |
| **Global CDN-style** | 10-30ms | $50k/month | ✅ Yes | ✅ Very High |

**Latency Impact:**
```
Scenario: Crawling 1,000 pages/sec

Single Region (US-East):
- Fetch from US server: 50ms
- Fetch from EU server: 150ms
- Fetch from Asia server: 200ms
- Average: ~133ms (33% slower)

Multi-Region:
- US workers → US servers: 50ms
- EU workers → EU servers: 50ms
- Asia workers → Asia servers: 50ms
- Average: 50ms
```

### Decision Made

**✅ Multi-region Deployment (US-East, EU-West, Asia-Pacific)**

**Architecture:**
```
Global Infrastructure:
├── US-East Region
│   ├── Kafka (local)
│   ├── 10 Fetcher Workers
│   ├── Redis (duplicate filter)
│   └── S3 + Elasticsearch
├── EU-West Region
│   ├── Kafka (local)
│   ├── 10 Fetcher Workers
│   ├── Redis (duplicate filter)
│   └── S3 + Elasticsearch
└── Asia-Pacific Region
    ├── Kafka (local)
    ├── 10 Fetcher Workers
    ├── Redis (duplicate filter)
    └── S3 + Elasticsearch

Global Coordination:
- URLs routed to region based on domain geo-location
- Results aggregated globally (Elasticsearch Federation)
```

### Rationale

1. **2-3x lower latency:** Fetch from nearby servers (50ms vs 150ms)
2. **Regulatory compliance:** EU data stays in EU (GDPR)
3. **Fault tolerance:** If one region fails, others continue
4. **Higher throughput:** 3 regions × 10 workers = 30 total workers
5. **Real-world standard:** Google, Bing use multi-region crawling

### Trade-offs Accepted

| Trade-off | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **3x cost** | $20k vs $7k/month | Justified by 2-3x speedup + compliance |
| **Operational complexity** | 3 regions to manage | Use managed services (AWS, GCP) |
| **Data synchronization** | Duplicate filters must sync | Redis Cluster with cross-region replication |
| **Geo-routing complexity** | Need to map domains to regions | Use MaxMind GeoIP database |

### When to Reconsider

**Switch to Single Region if:**
- Crawling only US websites (no global coverage)
- Budget is limited (<$10k/month)
- Latency > 200ms is acceptable
- No regulatory compliance needed

**Switch to Global CDN-style if:**
- Need ultra-low latency (<30ms)
- Budget allows $50k/month
- Crawling is mission-critical (search engine)

**Never use Multi-region if:**
- Crawling < 100 pages/sec (overkill)
- All target servers are in one region
- Team lacks multi-region ops experience

## 10. Trade-offs Summary

This table summarizes all 9 major design decisions for the Distributed Web Crawler:

| Decision | What We Chose | Primary Benefit | Main Trade-off | When to Reconsider |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **1. Duplicate Detection** | Bloom Filter + Redis | 99% memory savings ($4k vs $36k/month) | 1% false positives | Scale < 1B URLs |
| **2. URL Queue** | Kafka (multi-topic) | High throughput (100k msgs/sec), fault tolerance | Operational complexity | Throughput < 3k QPS |
| **3. Politeness** | Distributed Locks (Redis) | Perfect concurrency control per domain | 5-10ms lock latency | < 5 workers (sticky assignment) |
| **4. Crawl Strategy** | Async I/O (aiohttp/Go) | 100x throughput vs single-threaded | Async complexity | Team has no async experience |
| **5. Storage** | S3 + Elasticsearch | Cost-effective ($6.8k vs $10k), fast search | Two systems to manage | Scale < 1 TB |
| **6. Rate Limiting** | Token Bucket | Burst support, industry standard | Bursty traffic (not smooth) | Need perfectly smooth rate |
| **7. JavaScript** | Static + Selective Headless | 90% cost savings ($3.3k vs $30k/month) | Misses JS on unknown sites | Need 100% coverage |
| **8. Priority** | Multi-topic Kafka (3 levels) | No starvation, high throughput | Only 3 priority levels | Need infinite priorities |
| **9. Deployment** | Multi-region (3 regions) | 2-3x lower latency, compliance | 3x cost ($20k vs $7k) | Crawling single region only |

### Cost Analysis

**Monthly Infrastructure Costs (at 1B pages/month):**

| Component | Choice | Monthly Cost | Alternative | Alternative Cost | Savings |
|-----------|--------|--------------|-------------|------------------|---------|
| Duplicate Detection | Bloom + Redis | $4,000 | Pure Redis | $36,000 | $32,000 |
| URL Queue | Kafka | $2,000 | PostgreSQL | $10,000 | $8,000 |
| Storage | S3 + ES | $6,800 | Pure PostgreSQL | $10,000 | $3,200 |
| Workers | Async (30 instances) | $3,000 | Sync (500 instances) | $50,000 | $47,000 |
| JavaScript Rendering | Selective | $3,300 | All headless | $30,000 | $26,700 |
| **Total** | **Our Architecture** | **$19,100** | **Alternative** | **$136,000** | **$116,900 (86% savings)** |

**Key Insight:** Smart architectural decisions save **$116,900/month** (86%) while maintaining comparable performance and better scalability.
