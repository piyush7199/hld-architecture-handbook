## 1. User Registration and Initial Connection

**Flow:** Complete flow from app launch to establishing persistent WebSocket connection.

**Steps:**

1. **App Launch** (0ms): User opens mobile app
2. **Authentication** (100ms): Login with credentials, receive JWT token
3. **DNS Resolution** (20ms): Resolve load balancer IP
4. **HTTP Upgrade** (50ms): Upgrade to WebSocket protocol
5. **JWT Validation** (10ms): Server validates token
6. **Connection Registration** (5ms): Store connection mapping
7. **Presence Update** (2ms): Set user online in Redis
8. **Fetch Offline Messages** (50ms): Get any pending messages from queue
9. **Subscribe to Chat Rooms** (20ms): Load active chats from database
10. **Connection Ready** (~300ms total): User can send/receive messages

## 3. Receive Message (Online User)

**Flow:** Delivery worker pushes message to online recipient via WebSocket.

**Steps:**

1. **Delivery Worker Reads from Kafka** (0ms): Consumer pulls message
2. **Parse Message** (1ms): Extract recipient_id, content, metadata
3. **Check Presence** (1ms): Query Redis to confirm user online
4. **Lookup WebSocket Server** (2ms): Find which server has the connection
5. **Route to Server** (5ms): Internal RPC to target WebSocket server
6. **Push to Client** (10ms): WebSocket push to recipient
7. **Client ACK** (10ms): Client acknowledges receipt
8. **Update Status** (20ms): Write delivery timestamp to database

## 4. Receive Message (Offline User with Push Notification)

**Flow:** User is offline, message queued and push notification sent to device.

**Steps:**

1. **Check Presence** (0ms): User is offline (Redis key not found)
2. **Add to Offline Queue** (2ms): Push message to Redis LIST
3. **Check Queue Depth** (1ms): How many pending messages?
4. **Send Push Notification** (100-500ms): Via FCM/APNS
5. **User Sees Notification** (500ms): Lock screen notification
6. **User Taps Notification** (user action): Opens app
7. **Reconnect** (300ms): WebSocket connection established
8. **Fetch Offline Messages** (50ms): Retrieve all pending messages
9. **Deliver All** (100ms): Push all messages to client
10. **Clear Queue** (2ms): Delete offline queue

## 5. Group Message Send Flow

**Flow:** User sends message to group with 50 members, fanout to all online members.

**Steps:**

1. **User Sends to Group** (0ms): Message posted to group chat
2. **Single Kafka Write** (5ms): One message to Kafka (by group_id)
3. **Fanout Workers** (parallel): 5 workers each handle 10 members
4. **Check Presence** (per member): Online or offline?
5. **Online Members** (20/50): Push via WebSocket (~100ms)
6. **Offline Members** (30/50): Queue + push notification (~500ms)
7. **All Delivered** (1-2s): All 50 members received or queued

## 6. Read Receipt Flow

**Flow:** User reads message, sender receives blue checkmark notification.

**Steps:**

1. **User Opens Chat** (0ms): User views conversation
2. **Client Sends READ Event** (10ms): Mark message as read
3. **Publish to Kafka** (5ms): Separate topic for read receipts
4. **Update Database** (20ms): Write read_at timestamp
5. **Notify Sender** (50ms): Push notification to sender's WebSocket
6. **Sender's UI Updates** (60ms): Blue checkmark appears

## 7. Typing Indicator Flow

**Flow:** Real-time typing indicator (ephemeral, not persisted).

**Steps:**

1. **User Types** (0ms): Keypress detected
2. **Throttle** (500ms): Only send every 500ms
3. **Publish to Redis Pub/Sub** (5ms): Lightweight, non-durable
4. **Recipient Subscribes** (0ms): Already subscribed to chat channel
5. **Push to Recipient** (10ms): "Alice is typing..."
6. **Auto-Expire** (3s): Clear indicator after 3 seconds if no new events

## 8. User Reconnection After Network Failure

**Flow:** User loses connection (network drop), automatically reconnects.

**Steps:**

1. **Network Failure** (0s): Connection lost (airplane mode, tunnel, etc.)
2. **Client Detects** (5s): Heartbeat timeout
3. **WebSocket Closed** (5s): Connection terminated
4. **Retry with Backoff** (6s, 8s, 12s, 20s): Exponential backoff
5. **Network Restored** (20s): Connection possible again
6. **Reconnect** (21s): New WebSocket connection
7. **Authenticate** (21.1s): Reuse existing JWT
8. **Fetch Missed Messages** (21.2s): Get messages since last_received_id
9. **Connection Restored** (21.5s): User back online

## 9. Message Editing Flow

**Flow:** User edits previously sent message (within 15-minute window).

**Steps:**

1. **User Selects Edit** (0ms): Long-press message, choose "Edit"
2. **Client Validates** (0ms): Check if < 15 minutes old
3. **Send Edit Request** (10ms): Include original message_id + new content
4. **Publish to Kafka** (5ms): EDIT event
5. **Update Database** (20ms): Write edit history
6. **Fanout to Recipients** (100ms): Push edit notification
7. **Recipients See Update** (150ms): "(edited)" tag appears

## 10. Message Deletion Flow

**Flow:** User deletes message (delete for everyone, within 1-hour window).

**Steps:**

1. **User Selects Delete** (0ms): Long-press, choose "Delete for everyone"
2. **Client Validates** (0ms): Check if < 1 hour old
3. **Send Delete Request** (10ms): Include message_id
4. **Publish to Kafka** (5ms): DELETE event
5. **Soft Delete in Database** (20ms): Mark as deleted, keep metadata
6. **Fanout to Recipients** (100ms): Push delete notification
7. **Recipients See Update** (150ms): Message replaced with "🚫 This message was deleted"

## 11. WebSocket Server Failure and Reconnection

**Flow:** WebSocket server crashes, 100K users reconnect to other servers.

**Steps:**

1. **Server Crash** (0s): ws-server-42 crashes (OOM, hardware failure)
2. **Health Check Fails** (5s): Load balancer detects failure
3. **Remove from Pool** (6s): Stop routing new connections
4. **100K Connections Lost** (6s): All users disconnected
5. **Client Auto-Reconnect** (7-15s): Staggered reconnect with backoff
6. **Load Balancer Routes** (7-15s): Distribute to healthy servers
7. **All Reconnected** (30s): 100K users back online

## 12. Kafka Consumer Lag Recovery

**Flow:** Delivery worker crashes, consumer lag builds up, recovery process.

**Steps:**

1. **Worker Crash** (0s): Delivery worker crashes
2. **Consumer Group Rebalance** (10s): Kafka reassigns partitions
3. **Lag Builds Up** (10-60s): 50K messages queued
4. **Auto-Scale** (60s): Add 10 more workers
5. **Catch Up** (120s): Process backlog at 2× speed
6. **Normal Operation** (180s): Lag reduced to < 1000 messages
