## 1. Standard Tweet Posting Flow (Normal User)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant LB as Load Balancer
    participant API as API Gateway
    participant PS as Post Service
    participant PG as PostgreSQL
    participant Kafka
    participant FW as Fanout Worker
    participant FG as Follower Graph
    participant Cass as Cassandra
    participant Redis

    Client->>LB: POST /tweet {content}
    LB->>API: Forward request
    API->>API: Authenticate user<br/>Check rate limit
    API->>PS: POST /tweet
    
    PS->>PS: Validate content<br/>Generate Snowflake ID
    PS->>PG: INSERT INTO tweets
    PG-->>PS: Success (tweet_id)
    
    PS->>Kafka: Publish (tweet_id, user_id)
    Kafka-->>PS: Ack
    
    PS-->>API: 201 Created {tweet_id}
    API-->>LB: Response
    LB-->>Client: Success (~100ms)
    
    Note over Kafka,FW: Async Fanout Begins
    
    Kafka->>FW: Consume tweet event
    FW->>FG: GET /followers/{user_id}
    FG-->>FW: [follower_ids]
    
    loop For each follower
        FW->>Cass: INSERT INTO user_timeline
    end
    
    FW->>Redis: LPUSH user:{id}:timeline
    Redis-->>FW: OK
    
    Note over FW: Fanout complete (~10s)
```

**Flow:**

This shows the complete flow of a normal user posting a tweet from client request to fanout completion.

**Steps:**
1. **Client Request** (0ms): User posts tweet via mobile/web app
2. **Load Balancer** (5ms): Routes to nearest data center
3. **API Gateway** (10ms): JWT validation, rate limit check (e.g., 300 tweets/hour)
4. **Post Service** (20ms):
   - Validates content (length ≤280 chars, no spam)
   - Generates Snowflake ID (time-sortable, unique)
5. **PostgreSQL** (20ms): Inserts tweet into tweets table (ACID)
6. **Kafka** (5ms): Publishes event to `new_tweets` topic (non-blocking)
7. **Return to Client** (~100ms total): User sees "Tweet posted" confirmation

**Async Fanout** (background, ~10 seconds):
8. **Fanout Worker** consumes event from Kafka
9. **Follower Graph** query returns list of followers (e.g., 5,000 users)
10. **Cassandra** inserts tweet into each follower's timeline (batch writes)
11. **Redis** updates cache for active followers

**Performance:**
- Client response: <100ms (user doesn't wait for fanout)
- Fanout completion: ~10 seconds (for 5,000 followers)
- Celebrity handling: Different flow (see diagram #4)

## 2. Timeline Loading (Cache Hit - Fast Path)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant LB as Load Balancer
    participant TS as Timeline Service
    participant Redis
    
    Client->>LB: GET /timeline
    LB->>TS: Forward request
    
    TS->>Redis: GET user:{id}:timeline
    Redis-->>TS: [tweet_ids] (Cache Hit)
    
    TS->>Redis: MGET tweet:{id1}, tweet:{id2}...
    Redis-->>TS: [tweet_data]
    
    TS->>TS: Format response
    TS-->>LB: 200 OK {tweets}
    LB-->>Client: Response (~10ms)
```

**Flow:**

Shows the fastest path - timeline served entirely from Redis cache.

**Steps:**
1. **Client Request** (0ms): User opens app/refreshes timeline
2. **Load Balancer** (2ms): Routes to nearest Timeline Service
3. **Timeline Service** (1ms): Constructs cache key `user:{user_id}:timeline`
4. **Redis GET** (2ms): Retrieves list of tweet IDs from cache
5. **Cache Hit** ✅: Timeline exists in cache (90% of requests)
6. **Redis MGET** (3ms): Batch-fetch full tweet data (50 tweets in one call)
7. **Format Response** (2ms): JSON serialization, add metadata
8. **Return to Client** (~10ms total): User sees timeline instantly

**Cache Data Structure:**
```
user:12345:timeline → [tweet_id_1, tweet_id_2, ..., tweet_id_50]
tweet:67890 → {id, user_id, content, created_at, likes, ...}
```

**Performance:**
- P50: 5ms
- P99: 10ms
- P999: 20ms

**Cache TTL:** 1 hour (automatic expiration)

---

## 3. Timeline Loading (Cache Miss - Slow Path)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant LB as Load Balancer
    participant TS as Timeline Service
    participant Redis
    participant Cass as Cassandra
    
    Client->>LB: GET /timeline
    LB->>TS: Forward request
    
    TS->>Redis: GET user:{id}:timeline
    Redis-->>TS: nil (Cache Miss)
    
    TS->>Cass: SELECT * FROM user_timeline<br/>WHERE user_id = ?<br/>LIMIT 50
    Cass-->>TS: [timeline_entries]
    
    TS->>TS: Extract tweet data<br/>Format response
    
    TS->>Redis: SET user:{id}:timeline<br/>EX 3600
    Redis-->>TS: OK
    
    TS-->>LB: 200 OK {tweets}
    LB-->>Client: Response (~50ms)
```

**Flow:**

Shows the slower path when timeline is not in cache (10% of requests).

**Steps:**
1. **Client Request** (0ms): User opens app (first time or after cache expiry)
2. **Timeline Service** (1ms): Constructs cache key
3. **Redis GET** (2ms): Attempts to retrieve from cache
4. **Cache Miss** ❌: Timeline not in cache (user inactive or cache evicted)
5. **Cassandra Query** (30ms):
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM user_timeline 
   WHERE user_id = 12345 
   LIMIT 50;
   ```
   - Partition key lookup (user_id) → O(1)
   - Clustering key sorted (tweet_id DESC) → no sort needed
   - Returns 50 most recent tweets
6. **Format Response** (5ms): Deserialize tweet data, apply ranking
7. **Populate Cache** (5ms): Store in Redis with 1-hour TTL
8. **Return to Client** (~50ms total): Acceptable latency for cache miss

**Performance:**
- P50: 30ms
- P99: 50ms
- P999: 100ms

**Cache Warming:** Background job pre-populates cache for active users.

## 4. Hybrid Fanout: Celebrity Tweet

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Celebrity
    participant PS as Post Service
    participant PG as PostgreSQL
    participant Kafka
    participant FW as Fanout Worker
    participant FG as Follower Graph
    
    Celebrity->>PS: POST /tweet
    PS->>PS: Generate tweet_id
    PS->>PG: INSERT INTO tweets
    PG-->>PS: Success
    
    PS->>Kafka: Publish (tweet_id, user_id)
    PS-->>Celebrity: 201 Created (~100ms)
    
    Kafka->>FW: Consume event
    FW->>FG: GET /followers/{celebrity_id}
    FG-->>FW: [10M followers]
    
    FW->>FW: Check follower count
    Note over FW: Count > 10K<br/>Skip fanout (pull model)
    
    FW->>PG: UPDATE tweets<br/>SET is_celebrity = true
    FW-->>Kafka: Commit offset
    
    Note over FW: No timeline inserts<br/>(saves 10M writes!)
```

**Flow:**

Shows how the system handles celebrity tweets to avoid the fanout explosion.

**Steps:**
1. **Celebrity Posts** (0ms): @Cristiano (500M followers) posts tweet
2. **Post Service** (same as normal): Validate, generate ID, save to PostgreSQL
3. **Kafka Publish** (5ms): Event published to queue
4. **Return to Celebrity** (~100ms): Same experience as normal user
5. **Fanout Worker** consumes event
6. **Follower Graph Query** returns massive follower count (10M+)
7. **Celebrity Detection** ✅: Follower count > 10,000 threshold
8. **Skip Fanout** 🚫: Do NOT insert into timelines
9. **Mark Tweet** (optional): Flag as celebrity tweet for pull-based retrieval

**Savings:**
- **Normal user (5K followers):** 5,000 writes
- **Celebrity (10M followers):** 0 writes (100% reduction)
- **Infrastructure cost:** Saves millions in database writes

**Read-Time Handling:** See next diagram.

## 5. Timeline Loading with Celebrity Tweets (Hybrid Read)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant TS as Timeline Service
    participant Redis
    participant Cass as Cassandra
    participant PG as PostgreSQL
    
    Client->>TS: GET /timeline
    
    TS->>Redis: GET user:{id}:timeline
    Redis-->>TS: [normal_user_tweets]
    
    TS->>PG: SELECT followees<br/>WHERE is_celebrity = true
    PG-->>TS: [celebrity_ids]
    
    loop For each celebrity
        TS->>PG: SELECT * FROM tweets<br/>WHERE user_id = celebrity_id<br/>LIMIT 10
    end
    PG-->>TS: [celebrity_tweets]
    
    TS->>TS: Merge normal + celebrity<br/>Sort by created_at DESC<br/>Take top 50
    
    TS-->>Client: 200 OK {merged_timeline}<br/>(~30ms, +20ms overhead)
```

**Flow:**

Shows how timelines are loaded for users following celebrities (hybrid model).

**Steps:**
1. **Client Request** (0ms): User who follows @Cristiano requests timeline
2. **Fetch Pre-computed Timeline** (10ms):
   - Get from Redis cache (tweets from normal users)
   - Contains ~40 tweets from non-celebrity followees
3. **Identify Celebrities** (2ms):
   - Query which followees are celebrities
   - User follows 3 celebrities
4. **Fetch Celebrity Tweets** (10ms):
   - For each celebrity: Get their 10 most recent tweets
   - Batch query or parallel fetch
   - Total: 30 celebrity tweets
5. **Merge & Sort** (5ms):
   - Combine pre-computed (40) + celebrity (30) = 70 tweets
   - Sort by `created_at DESC`
   - Take top 50
6. **Return to Client** (~30ms total): 20ms overhead vs pure cache hit

**Optimization: Celebrity Tweet Cache**
```
celebrity:12345:recent_tweets → [last 100 tweet_ids]
TTL: 10 minutes
```

**Performance:**
- Without optimization: ~50ms (query PostgreSQL each time)
- With celebrity cache: ~30ms (20ms overhead)
- Pure cache hit (no celebrities): ~10ms

**Trade-off:** Slightly slower for users following many celebrities, but system remains stable.

## 6. Fanout with Activity-Based Filtering

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Kafka
    participant FW as Fanout Worker
    participant FG as Follower Graph
    participant UDB as User DB
    participant Cass as Cassandra
    participant Redis
    
    Kafka->>FW: Consume tweet event
    FW->>FG: GET /followers/{user_id}
    FG-->>FW: [100K followers]
    
    FW->>UDB: SELECT follower_id<br/>WHERE last_login > NOW() - 30 days
    UDB-->>FW: [40K active followers]
    
    Note over FW: 60% reduction<br/>(60K inactive skipped)
    
    loop For each active follower (40K)
        FW->>Cass: INSERT INTO user_timeline
    end
    
    FW->>Redis: LPUSH (active followers only)
    Redis-->>FW: OK
    
    Note over FW: Fanout complete<br/>40K writes instead of 100K
```

**Flow:**

Shows optimization to reduce wasted writes to inactive users.

**Steps:**
1. **Kafka Event** (0ms): Tweet posted by user with 100K followers
2. **Fetch All Followers** (50ms): Get complete follower list
3. **Activity Filter** (100ms):
   ```sql
   SELECT follower_id 
   FROM followers f
   JOIN users u ON f.follower_id = u.user_id
   WHERE f.followee_id = ?
     AND u.last_login > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
   ```
   - Returns 40K active followers (40% of total)
   - Skips 60K inactive followers
4. **Fanout to Active Only** (5 seconds):
   - Insert tweet into 40K timelines (Cassandra)
   - Update Redis cache for active users
5. **Complete** ✅: 60% reduction in writes

**Inactive User Handling:**
- On next login: Pull recent tweets (fanout-on-read)
- Build timeline on-demand
- Slightly slower first load (acceptable)

**Benefits:**
- **Cost Savings:** 60% fewer database writes
- **Faster Fanout:** 60% faster completion
- **No User Impact:** Inactive users don't notice

**Monitoring:**
- Track active ratio (target: 40-50%)
- Alert if active ratio drops (indicates retention problem)

## 7. Kafka Failover and Consumer Rebalancing

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Kafka as Kafka Broker
    participant FW1 as Fanout Worker 1
    participant FW2 as Fanout Worker 2
    participant FW3 as Fanout Worker 3
    participant ZK as ZooKeeper
    
    Note over Kafka,FW3: Initial State<br/>FW1: P0-P21<br/>FW2: P22-P42<br/>FW3: P43-P63
    
    Kafka->>FW1: Send events (P0-P21)
    Kafka->>FW2: Send events (P22-P42)
    Kafka->>FW3: Send events (P43-P63)
    
    FW1->>FW1: Process events
    FW2->>FW2: Process events
    FW3->>FW3: Process events
    
    Note over FW2: Worker 2 Crashes
    FW2-xKafka: Heartbeat timeout
    
    Kafka->>ZK: Worker 2 disconnected
    ZK->>Kafka: Trigger rebalance
    
    Kafka->>FW1: Rebalance: Assign P0-P31
    Kafka->>FW3: Rebalance: Assign P32-P63
    
    Note over FW1,FW3: Partitions redistributed<br/>No data loss<br/>Resume from last offset
    
    FW1->>Kafka: Consume P22-P31 (from FW2)
    FW3->>Kafka: Continue P43-P63
```

**Flow:**

Shows Kafka's automatic failover when a fanout worker dies.

**Normal Operation:**
1. **Initial State**:
   - 3 fanout workers in consumer group
   - 64 partitions divided evenly
   - Each worker processes ~21 partitions
2. **Processing:**
   - Each worker consumes from assigned partitions
   - Commits offsets periodically (every 5 seconds)
   - Processes tweets, inserts into timelines

**Failure Scenario:**
3. **Worker 2 Crashes** (e.g., OOM, deployment, hardware failure)
4. **Heartbeat Timeout** (30 seconds):
   - Worker 2 stops sending heartbeats to Kafka
   - Kafka coordinator detects failure
5. **Rebalance Triggered**:
   - ZooKeeper notifies all workers
   - Kafka pauses consumption briefly (~5 seconds)
6. **Partition Reassignment**:
   - P22-P42 (from FW2) redistributed to FW1 and FW3
   - FW1 now handles P0-P31 (10 extra partitions)
   - FW3 now handles P32-P63 (10 extra partitions)
7. **Resume from Last Offset**:
   - Workers start from last committed offset
   - No messages lost (durability guaranteed)
   - Processing continues with 2 workers (degraded capacity)

**Recovery:**
8. **Auto-Scaling** (optional): Deploy new worker to restore capacity
9. **Another Rebalance:** Partitions redistributed to 3 workers

**Performance Impact:**
- **During Rebalance:** ~5 seconds pause (acceptable)
- **Post-Rebalance:** 50% higher load per worker (temporary)
- **Consumer Lag:** May increase temporarily, recovers as workers catch up

**Monitoring:**
- Alert when consumer group size changes
- Track consumer lag during rebalance
- Auto-scale if lag exceeds threshold

## 8. Multi-Region Tweet Propagation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as Client (US)
    participant US_PS as US Post Service
    participant US_PG as US PostgreSQL
    participant US_Kafka as US Kafka
    participant MM as MirrorMaker
    participant EU_Kafka as EU Kafka
    participant EU_FW as EU Fanout Worker
    participant EU_Cass as EU Cassandra
    
    Client->>US_PS: POST /tweet
    US_PS->>US_PG: INSERT INTO tweets
    US_PG-->>US_PS: Success
    US_PS->>US_Kafka: Publish event
    US_PS-->>Client: 201 Created (100ms)
    
    Note over US_PG: Async Replication
    US_PG-.->EU_PG: Replicate tweet (2s lag)
    
    US_Kafka->>MM: Consume (US region)
    MM->>EU_Kafka: Produce (EU region)
    Note over MM: Cross-region replication<br/>~500ms latency
    
    EU_Kafka->>EU_FW: Consume event
    EU_FW->>EU_Cass: Fanout to EU followers
    
    Note over EU_Cass: EU users see tweet<br/>~3 seconds after post
```

**Flow:**

Shows how tweets are propagated across geographic regions for global availability.

**Steps:**
1. **US User Posts Tweet** (0ms): Client in US posts to US data center
2. **US Processing** (100ms):
   - Save to US PostgreSQL
   - Publish to US Kafka
   - Return success to client
3. **US Fanout** (10 seconds): Fanout to US-based followers
4. **Cross-Region Replication** (async):
   - **PostgreSQL:** Master-slave async replication (~2 second lag)
   - **Kafka:** MirrorMaker copies events to EU Kafka (~500ms lag)
5. **EU Fanout** (10 seconds): EU workers fanout to EU-based followers
6. **EU Users See Tweet** (~3 seconds total):
   - From tweet post (US) to visible in timeline (EU)
   - Acceptable eventual consistency

**Consistency Model:**
- **Within Region:** Strong consistency (<1 second)
- **Cross-Region:** Eventual consistency (2-5 seconds)
- **User Experience:** Imperceptible delay for most users

**Benefits:**
- **Low Latency:** Users always access nearest region
- **High Availability:** Region failure doesn't affect others
- **Data Residency:** Compliance with local regulations

**Edge Case:** User in US follows user in EU
- EU user posts → Replicates to US (~3 seconds)
- US follower sees tweet with ~3 second delay
- Acceptable for social media use case

## 9. Rate Limiting Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API as API Gateway
    participant RL as Rate Limiter<br/>(Redis)
    participant PS as Post Service
    
    Client->>API: POST /tweet (Request 1)
    API->>RL: INCR user:12345:tweets:hour
    RL-->>API: Count: 1 (< 300 limit)
    API->>PS: Forward request
    PS-->>API: Success
    API-->>Client: 201 Created
    
    Note over Client,PS: ... 299 more tweets ...
    
    Client->>API: POST /tweet (Request 300)
    API->>RL: INCR user:12345:tweets:hour
    RL-->>API: Count: 300 (= limit)
    API->>PS: Forward request
    PS-->>API: Success
    API-->>Client: 201 Created
    
    Client->>API: POST /tweet (Request 301)
    API->>RL: INCR user:12345:tweets:hour
    RL-->>API: Count: 301 (> 300 limit)
    API-->>Client: 429 Too Many Requests<br/>Retry-After: 3600
    
    Note over Client,RL: User waits for window reset
    
    Note over RL: After 1 hour
    RL->>RL: Key expires (TTL)
    
    Client->>API: POST /tweet (Next hour)
    API->>RL: INCR user:12345:tweets:hour
    RL-->>API: Count: 1 (reset)
    API->>PS: Forward request
    PS-->>API: Success
    API-->>Client: 201 Created
```

**Flow:**

Shows rate limiting implementation to prevent spam and abuse.

**Steps:**
1. **First Request** (0ms): User posts tweet
2. **Rate Limit Check** (2ms):
   ```redis
   INCR user:12345:tweets:hour
   EXPIRE user:12345:tweets:hour 3600
   ```
   - Increment counter for this user
   - Set TTL to 1 hour (sliding window)
3. **Within Limit** (Count ≤ 300): Allow request, forward to Post Service
4. **Subsequent Requests**: Counter increments with each tweet
5. **At Limit** (Count = 300): Last allowed tweet, warn user
6. **Exceed Limit** (Count > 300):
   - Return `429 Too Many Requests`
   - Include `Retry-After: 3600` header (seconds until reset)
   - Block request (don't forward to Post Service)
7. **Window Reset** (1 hour later):
   - Redis key expires (TTL)
   - Counter resets to 0
   - User can post again

**Rate Limit Tiers:**
- **Free Users:** 300 tweets/hour, 2,400 tweets/day
- **Verified Users:** 500 tweets/hour, 5,000 tweets/day
- **Premium Users:** 1,000 tweets/hour, 10,000 tweets/day

**Implementation (Redis):**
```
user:12345:tweets:hour → 150 (TTL: 1800s remaining)
user:12345:tweets:day → 800 (TTL: 43200s remaining)
```

**Benefits:**
- **Spam Prevention:** Blocks automated bots
- **Fair Usage:** Ensures platform quality
- **Cost Control:** Prevents infrastructure abuse

**Monitoring:**
- Track rate limit hit rate per tier
- Alert if >10% users hitting limits (may indicate limit too low)

## 10. Cache Invalidation on Tweet Deletion

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant PS as Post Service
    participant PG as PostgreSQL
    participant Kafka
    participant CIW as Cache Invalidation Worker
    participant FG as Follower Graph
    participant Redis
    participant Cass as Cassandra
    
    Client->>PS: DELETE /tweet/{id}
    PS->>PG: UPDATE tweets<br/>SET status = 'DELETED'
    PG-->>PS: Success
    
    PS->>Kafka: Publish (event: tweet_deleted, tweet_id, user_id)
    PS-->>Client: 204 No Content
    
    Kafka->>CIW: Consume deletion event
    CIW->>FG: GET /followers/{user_id}
    FG-->>CIW: [follower_ids]
    
    loop For each follower
        CIW->>Redis: LREM user:{id}:timeline tweet_id
        CIW->>Cass: DELETE FROM user_timeline<br/>WHERE user_id = ? AND tweet_id = ?
    end
    
    CIW-->>Kafka: Commit offset
    
    Note over Redis,Cass: Tweet removed from<br/>all timelines (~30 seconds)
```

**Flow:**

Shows how deleted tweets are removed from all followers' timelines.

**Steps:**
1. **User Deletes Tweet** (0ms): Author requests deletion
2. **Soft Delete** (20ms):
   - Update tweet status to 'DELETED' in PostgreSQL
   - Don't actually delete (for audit/moderation)
   - Tweet no longer visible via API
3. **Return to Client** (~50ms): Immediate confirmation
4. **Publish Deletion Event** (5ms):
   - Kafka topic: `tweet_deleted`
   - Contains: tweet_id, author_user_id
5. **Cache Invalidation Worker** (async):
   - Consumes deletion events
   - Fetches all followers (same as fanout)
6. **Remove from Redis** (10ms per follower):
   ```redis
   LREM user:67890:timeline 0 tweet_id_123
   ```
   - Removes tweet from cached timeline
7. **Remove from Cassandra** (20ms per follower):
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM user_timeline 
   WHERE user_id = ? AND tweet_id = ?;
   ```
8. **Complete** (~30 seconds): Tweet removed from all timelines

**Edge Cases:**
- **Cache TTL:** Timelines in cache might show deleted tweet for up to 1 hour (until TTL expires)
- **Eventual Consistency:** Some users might see deleted tweet for ~30 seconds
- **Acceptable:** Social media doesn't require immediate deletion

**Optimization:**
- **Lazy Deletion:** Only remove from cache, leave in Cassandra
- **Filter on Read:** Timeline Service filters out deleted tweets
- **Trade-off:** Faster deletion vs more storage used

**Compliance:**
- **Legal Deletion:** If legally required (GDPR), hard delete from all systems
- **Process:** Separate compliance worker does thorough cleanup

## 11. Cassandra Write Failure and Retry

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant FW as Fanout Worker
    participant C1 as Cassandra Node 1
    participant C2 as Cassandra Node 2
    participant C3 as Cassandra Node 3

**Flow:**

Shows Cassandra's fault tolerance when a replica node is down.

**Normal Write (Success):**
1. **Fanout Worker** writes to Cassandra (Replication Factor = 3)
2. **Coordinator (Node 1)** receives write
3. **Replication**:
   - Write to local commit log (Node 1)
   - Replicate to Node 2 ✅ (Ack received)
   - Replicate to Node 3 ❌ (Node is down, timeout)
4. **Quorum Check:**
   - Consistency Level: QUORUM (requires 2/3 acks)
   - Received: 2 acks (Node 1 + Node 2)
   - QUORUM met → Return success to client
5. **Write Succeeds** ✅ (despite Node 3 failure)

**Recovery:**
6. **Hinted Handoff:**
   - Node 1 stores hint: "Node 3 needs this write"
   - When Node 3 recovers, hint replayed
   - Node 3 catches up asynchronously
7. **Eventual Consistency:** All 3 replicas have data within seconds

**Failure Modes:**

**Scenario 1: 1 Node Down (2/3 acks)**
- QUORUM met → Write succeeds
- System continues normally

**Scenario 2: 2 Nodes Down (1/3 acks)**
- QUORUM NOT met → Write fails
- Fanout worker retries with exponential backoff
- If retry limit exceeded → Send to Dead Letter Queue

**Scenario 3: All Nodes Down**
- Writes fail immediately
- Fanout worker writes to DLQ
- Manual intervention required

**Benefits:**
- **High Availability:** System tolerates single node failure
- **No Data Loss:** Hinted handoff ensures eventual delivery
- **Tunable Consistency:** Adjust CL based on requirements

**Monitoring:**
- Track hinted handoff queue size (should be ~0 normally)
- Alert if multiple nodes down (degraded replication)
- Monitor write latency (increases during failures)

## 12. PostgreSQL Failover (Primary Failure)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant PS as Post Service
    participant PG_Primary as PostgreSQL Primary
    participant PG_Replica1 as PostgreSQL Replica 1
    participant PG_Replica2 as PostgreSQL Replica 2
    participant Sentinel as Sentinel/Patroni
    
    PS->>PG_Primary: INSERT INTO tweets
    PG_Primary->>PG_Replica1: Streaming replication
    PG_Primary->>PG_Replica2: Streaming replication
    PG_Primary-->>PS: Success
    
    Note over PG_Primary: Primary crashes!
    PG_Primary-xSentinel: Heartbeat timeout
    
    Sentinel->>Sentinel: Detect failure<br/>Wait 30s (confirmation)
    Sentinel->>PG_Replica1: Check replication lag
    PG_Replica1-->>Sentinel: Lag: 2 seconds
    Sentinel->>PG_Replica2: Check replication lag
    PG_Replica2-->>Sentinel: Lag: 10 seconds
    
    Note over Sentinel: Promote Replica 1<br/>(lowest lag)
    
    Sentinel->>PG_Replica1: pg_ctl promote
    PG_Replica1->>PG_Replica1: Become primary<br/>Accept writes
    
    Sentinel->>PG_Replica2: Update config<br/>Replicate from new primary
    PG_Replica2->>PG_Replica1: Connect as replica
    
    Sentinel->>PS: Update connection pool<br/>New primary: Replica 1
    PS->>PG_Replica1: INSERT INTO tweets
    PG_Replica1-->>PS: Success
    
    Note over PS,PG_Replica1: Failover complete<br/>~60 seconds downtime
```

**Flow:**

Shows automatic failover when PostgreSQL primary fails.

**Normal Operation:**
1. **Primary Receives Writes:** All writes go to primary node
2. **Streaming Replication:** Changes stream to replicas in real-time
3. **Replicas Serve Reads:** Read queries load-balanced across replicas

**Failure Scenario:**
4. **Primary Crashes:**
   - Hardware failure, network partition, or OOM
   - Heartbeat to Sentinel stops
5. **Failure Detection** (30 seconds):
   - Sentinel (or Patroni) detects missing heartbeats
   - Confirms failure (avoids false positive)
6. **Candidate Selection**:
   - Query replication lag on all replicas
   - Replica 1: 2 seconds lag (best candidate)
   - Replica 2: 10 seconds lag
   - Choose Replica 1 (lowest lag = least data loss)
7. **Promotion** (15 seconds):
   ```bash
   pg_ctl promote -D /data
   ```
   - Replica 1 stops replicating
   - Becomes new primary
   - Starts accepting writes
8. **Reconfiguration** (15 seconds):
   - Update Replica 2 to replicate from new primary
   - Update DNS/load balancer (optional)
   - Notify application (connection pool update)
9. **Resume Operations** (~60 seconds total):
   - Post Service reconnects to new primary
   - Writes resume normally

**Data Loss:**
- **Best Case:** 0 seconds (if primary failure caught immediately)
- **Worst Case:** 2 seconds (replication lag)
- **Acceptable:** Social media tweets are not financial transactions

**Benefits:**
- **Automatic Recovery:** No manual intervention
- **Minimal Downtime:** ~60 seconds (industry-leading)
- **No Data Loss:** Synchronous replication option available (higher latency)

**Monitoring:**
- Alert when primary is down
- Track replication lag (should be <1 second normally)
- Verify automatic failover in test environment monthly
