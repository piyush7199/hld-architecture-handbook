# 2.3.1 Asynchronous Communication: Queues vs. Streams, Pub/Sub, and Backpressure

## Intuitive Explanation

When microservices talk, they can do it:

- **Synchronously (like a phone call):** Service A waits for a response from Service B before continuing. If B is slow,
  A is blocked.
- **Asynchronously (like sending an email):** Service A sends a message (event) and continues its work immediately,
  without waiting for Service B to process it.

Asynchronous communication is essential for **scalability** and **fault tolerance** because it decouples services.

---

## In-Depth Analysis

### 1. Message Queues (Queues)

A traditional message queue (like RabbitMQ or SQS) is a simple buffer designed for **point-to-point** communication.

- **Model**: **FIFO (First-In, First-Out).** A single message is typically delivered to only one consumer.
- **Purpose**: **Task Distribution and Load Leveling.** If the Checkout Service receives a burst of 100 orders, it puts
  them in
  the queue, and 10 fulfillment workers process them at their own pace.
- **Message State:** Once a consumer successfully processes and acknowledges a message, the message is **deleted** from
  the
  queue.

### 2. Message Streams (Streams)

A message stream (like Kafka or Redis Streams) is an immutable, ordered, and persistent log of events.

- **Model: Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub).** Multiple consumers can read the **same message** from the stream
  independently.
- **Purpose:** Data Integration and Event Sourcing. It allows different parts of the system (e.g., Inventory, Analytics,
  Notification) to react to the same event.
- **Message State:** Messages are **never deleted** (they expire based on time/size). Consumers track their own offset (
  position) in the log.

### 3. Pub/Sub Model

The core pattern used by streams, but also available in dedicated services (like AWS SNS).

- **Publisher**: Sends messages (events) to a **Topic** without knowing who is listening.
- **Subscriber**: Registers interest in a specific **Topic** and receives all messages published to it.
- Benefit: Enables loose coupling. If you add a new service (e.g., a Fraud Detection Service), you just subscribe it to
  the existing `ORDER_PLACED` topic without modifying the Order Service code.

### 4. Backpressure

Backpressure is a flow control mechanism used in asynchronous systems.

- **Problem**: The Producer (sender) generates data faster than the Consumer (processor) can handle. This leads to
  queues growing indefinitely, consuming resources, and crashing the consumer.
- **Solution (Pull-based):** The Consumer implicitly signals the Producer to slow down by simply **not requesting more
  data** from the broker until its internal processing queue is clear.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Design Challenge

### Problem

You are building a complex data pipeline for a social media site. The `USER_CREATED` event needs to trigger three
separate actions:

1) Send a welcome email,
2) Create a blank profile in the Profile DB
3) Update the Global User Count
   metric.

Explain why a Message Stream (Pub/Sub) is the ideal choice over a traditional Queue for handling the `USER_CREATED`
event. Justify your answer based on the number of consumers and message durability.

### Solution

#### üß© Scenario Summary

| Aspect            | Description                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Event**         | `USER_CREATED`                                              |
| **Consumers**     | 3 independent systems (Email, Profile, Metrics)             |
| **Delivery Need** | Each consumer must receive *its own copy* of the same event |
| **Reliability**   | Must handle at-least-once delivery, durable storage         |
| **Scalability**   | Future new consumers (e.g., analytics, fraud detection)     |

#### ‚úÖ Step 1: How a Traditional Queue Works

- In a **Queue**, messages are consumed and removed once processed.
- If multiple consumers subscribe to the same queue, messages are typically **load-balanced** ‚Äî not **broadcast**.

##### ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem

If you use a queue (e.g., RabbitMQ in work queue mode):

- The first consumer (say, Email Service) would consume the message.
- The other two (Profile and Metrics services) would never see it.

That violates your requirement that all three systems must react to the same event

#### ‚úÖ Step 2: How a Message Stream / Pub-Sub Works

- A Message Stream (Pub/Sub) system (e.g., Kafka, Pulsar, or Google Pub/Sub) allows:
    - One producer (USER_CREATED event emitter)
    - Multiple independent consumers, each with its own subscription.

Each consumer group gets a full copy of the event.

| Service         | Gets USER_CREATED event? | Processes Independently? |
|-----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Email Service   | ‚úÖ                        | Sends welcome email      |
| Profile Service | ‚úÖ                        | Inserts blank profile    |
| Metrics Service | ‚úÖ                        | Updates user counter     |

Even if one consumer is slow or temporarily offline, the event remains **durable** in the stream until it‚Äôs read.

#### ‚úÖ Step 3: Message Durability & Replay

- Message Streams persist events for a configurable duration (e.g., 7 days in Kafka).
- Consumers can replay old messages (useful for recovery or analytics).

This guarantees:

- **Durability:** Events aren‚Äôt lost on consumer failure.
- **Independence:** Consumers can process at different speeds or reprocess events later.

In contrast, queues usually delete messages after acknowledgment ‚Äî **no replay** possible.

#### ‚úÖ Step 4: Scaling and Evolution

- Tomorrow, if you want to add a fourth consumer (e.g., ‚ÄúFraud Detection Service‚Äù), you can simply subscribe to the same
  topic.
- No code changes to existing systems or message producers.
- This makes Pub/Sub ideal for **event-driven architectures** and **microservice ecosystems.**

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 5: Summary Comparison

| Feature                    | Traditional Queue          | Message Stream (Pub/Sub)          |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Message delivery model** | 1 message ‚Üí 1 consumer     | 1 message ‚Üí all subscribers       |
| **Consumer independence**  | Shared                     | Isolated                          |
| **Message durability**     | Deleted after consumption  | Retained for replay               |
| **Ideal for**              | Work distribution          | Event broadcasting                |
| **Scalability**            | Limited                    | High (multiple consumers, topics) |
| **Example tech**           | RabbitMQ (queue mode), SQS | Kafka, Pulsar, Pub/Sub            |

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Trade-off

| Issue                | Explanation                                               |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Storage overhead** | Messages persist for a longer time ‚Üí higher storage cost  |
| **Consumer lag**     | Slow consumers may fall behind and need offset management |

These are acceptable trade-offs for reliability and flexibility.

#### ‚úÖ Final Summary

| Aspect          | Design Decision                      | Reason                                                     |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pattern**     | **Message Stream (Pub/Sub)**         | Multiple independent consumers must receive the same event |
| **Durability**  | Persistent log-based storage         | Ensures no data loss, supports replay                      |
| **Scalability** | New consumers can subscribe anytime  | Enables event-driven extensibility                         |
| **Trade-off**   | Slightly higher storage + complexity | Justified by reliability and flexibility                   |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Async Communication Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Synchronous Processing in Async Pipeline

**Problem:**
```python
# Message handler blocks on synchronous calls
def handle_order_created(message):
    order = json.loads(message.body)
    
    # Synchronous API call (blocks for 2 seconds)
    inventory_response = requests.post(
        "http://inventory-service/reserve",
        json=order
    )
    
    # Another synchronous call (blocks for 1 second)
    email_response = requests.post(
        "http://email-service/send",
        json=order
    )
    
    message.ack()
# Processing rate: 1 message every 3 seconds!
# 10 workers = 3.3 messages/sec max
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- **Blocks worker threads**: Can't process other messages
- **Low throughput**: Sequential processing
- **Cascading failures**: If email service is slow, entire pipeline slows
- **Poor resource utilization**: Workers sitting idle during I/O

**Better Approach:**
```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

# Async processing
async def handle_order_created(message):
    order = json.loads(message.body)
    
    # Concurrent async calls
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        inventory_task = session.post(
            "http://inventory-service/reserve",
            json=order
        )
        email_task = session.post(
            "http://email-service/send",
            json=order
        )
        
        # Wait for both concurrently (2 seconds total, not 3)
        inventory_resp, email_resp = await asyncio.gather(
            inventory_task,
            email_task
        )
    
    await message.ack()

# Or better: Chain messages
def handle_order_created(message):
    order = json.loads(message.body)
    
    # Publish to next queues (non-blocking)
    queue.publish("inventory.reserve", order)
    queue.publish("email.send", order)
    
    message.ack()
# Processing rate: 10,000+ messages/sec!
```

---

### Anti-Pattern 2: Not Handling Message Failures

**Problem:**
```python
def process_message(message):
    try:
        data = json.loads(message.body)
        result = do_expensive_work(data)
        save_to_database(result)
        message.ack()  # Acknowledge success
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        message.ack()  # ‚ùå BAD! Acking failed message
        # Message is lost forever!
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- **Silent data loss**: Failed messages disappear
- **No retry logic**: Transient errors become permanent
- **No alerting**: Nobody knows messages are failing
- **No Dead Letter Queue**: Can't inspect failed messages

**Better Approach:**
```python
MAX_RETRIES = 3

def process_message(message):
    retry_count = int(message.attributes.get('retry_count', 0))
    
    try:
        data = json.loads(message.body)
        result = do_expensive_work(data)
        save_to_database(result)
        message.ack()  # Success!
        
    except TransientError as e:
        # Transient error (network timeout, DB lock)
        if retry_count < MAX_RETRIES:
            # Requeue with exponential backoff
            delay = 2 ** retry_count  # 1s, 2s, 4s
            message.nack(delay=delay, retry_count=retry_count + 1)
            log.warning(f"Retrying message: {e}")
        else:
            # Max retries exceeded, send to DLQ
            dead_letter_queue.publish(message)
            message.ack()
            alert_team("Message sent to DLQ", message)
            
    except FatalError as e:
        # Fatal error (invalid data, business logic)
        dead_letter_queue.publish(message)
        message.ack()
        alert_team("Fatal error in message", message, e)
```

---

### Anti-Pattern 3: Large Message Payloads

**Problem:**
```python
# Sending 10 MB image in message
order = {
    "order_id": "123",
    "customer_id": "456",
    "product_image": base64.b64encode(image_bytes).decode(),  # 10 MB!
    "invoice_pdf": base64.b64encode(pdf_bytes).decode()  # 5 MB!
}

queue.publish("orders", json.dumps(order))
# Message is 15 MB!
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- **Queue limits**: Most queues have 256 KB - 1 MB limits
- **Network overhead**: Slow transmission
- **Memory pressure**: Consumers load entire message
- **Serialization cost**: Encoding/decoding overhead

**Better Approach:**
```python
# Store large data in object storage, send reference
# Upload to S3
image_url = s3.upload(image_bytes, f"images/{order_id}.jpg")
pdf_url = s3.upload(pdf_bytes, f"invoices/{order_id}.pdf")

# Small message with references
order = {
    "order_id": "123",
    "customer_id": "456",
    "product_image_url": image_url,  # Just URL
    "invoice_pdf_url": pdf_url  # Just URL
}

queue.publish("orders", json.dumps(order))
# Message is < 1 KB!

# Consumer fetches data if needed
def handle_order(message):
    order = json.loads(message.body)
    if needs_image:
        image = s3.download(order['product_image_url'])
```

**Rule of thumb**: Keep messages < 10 KB, use references for large data

---

### Anti-Pattern 4: No Idempotency

**Problem:**
```python
# Message might be delivered multiple times!
def handle_payment(message):
    payment = json.loads(message.body)
    
    # Charge customer (NOT idempotent)
    charge_customer(payment['customer_id'], payment['amount'])
    
    message.ack()

# If message is delivered twice:
# Customer charged $100 twice!
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- **At-least-once delivery**: Messages can be delivered multiple times
- **Duplicate processing**: Same action happens twice
- **Data corruption**: Double charges, duplicate records

**Better Approach:**
```python
def handle_payment(message):
    payment = json.loads(message.body)
    payment_id = payment['payment_id']  # Unique ID
    
    # Check if already processed (idempotency check)
    if redis.exists(f"payment:processed:{payment_id}"):
        message.ack()  # Already processed, skip
        return
    
    # Charge customer
    charge_customer(payment['customer_id'], payment['amount'])
    
    # Mark as processed (with TTL)
    redis.setex(f"payment:processed:{payment_id}", 86400, "1")
    
    message.ack()

# Or use database unique constraint
def handle_order(message):
    order = json.loads(message.body)
    
    try:
        db.execute("""
            INSERT INTO orders (order_id, customer_id, amount)
            VALUES (?, ?, ?)
        """, order['id'], order['customer_id'], order['amount'])
    except UniqueConstraintError:
        # Already exists, skip
        pass
    
    message.ack()
```

---

### Anti-Pattern 5: No Message Ordering When Needed

**Problem:**
```python
# User updates profile multiple times
queue.publish("user.updated", {"user_id": 123, "name": "Alice", "version": 1})
queue.publish("user.updated", {"user_id": 123, "name": "Bob", "version": 2})
queue.publish("user.updated", {"user_id": 123, "name": "Charlie", "version": 3})

# Messages processed out of order!
# Consumer 1 gets version 3
# Consumer 2 gets version 1
# Consumer 3 gets version 2

# Final state: name = "Bob" (wrong! should be "Charlie")
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- **Out-of-order processing**: Last write doesn't win
- **Inconsistent state**: Data corruption
- **Race conditions**: Concurrent updates conflict

**Better Approach:**
```python
# Option 1: Use message ordering (Kafka partitions)
# Partition by user_id ensures ordered delivery per user
def get_partition_key(message):
    return message['user_id']

queue.publish("user.updated", user_data, partition_key=user_data['user_id'])

# Option 2: Version-based conflict resolution
def handle_user_update(message):
    update = json.loads(message.body)
    
    # Only apply if newer version
    db.execute("""
        UPDATE users 
        SET name = ?, updated_at = ?
        WHERE user_id = ? AND version < ?
    """, update['name'], now(), update['user_id'], update['version'])
    
    message.ack()

# Option 3: Last-write-wins with timestamp
def handle_user_update(message):
    update = json.loads(message.body)
    
    current = db.get_user(update['user_id'])
    
    if update['timestamp'] > current['updated_at']:
        db.update_user(update)
    
    message.ack()
```

---

### Anti-Pattern 6: Blocking the Event Loop

**Problem:**
```python
# Async consumer with blocking operations
async def handle_message(message):
    data = json.loads(message.body)
    
    # ‚ùå Blocking I/O in async function!
    result = requests.get(f"http://api.example.com/data/{data['id']}")
    
    # ‚ùå Blocking sleep!
    time.sleep(5)
    
    # ‚ùå Blocking database query!
    db_result = psycopg2.connect(...).execute("SELECT * FROM users")
    
    await message.ack()

# Event loop is blocked, can't process other messages
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- **Defeats async benefits**: Blocks event loop
- **Low concurrency**: Can't handle multiple messages
- **Poor performance**: Slower than sync code

**Better Approach:**
```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp
import asyncpg

async def handle_message(message):
    data = json.loads(message.body)
    
    # ‚úÖ Async HTTP client
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        result = await session.get(f"http://api.example.com/data/{data['id']}")
    
    # ‚úÖ Async sleep
    await asyncio.sleep(5)
    
    # ‚úÖ Async database driver
    conn = await asyncpg.connect(...)
    db_result = await conn.fetch("SELECT * FROM users")
    
    await message.ack()

# Event loop can handle many messages concurrently
```

---

### Anti-Pattern 7: No Monitoring or Observability

**Problem:**
```python
# "Fire and forget" message publishing
def create_order(order_data):
    db.insert_order(order_data)
    queue.publish("order.created", order_data)
    return {"status": "ok"}

# Questions you can't answer:
# - Is the queue healthy?
# - Are messages being processed?
# - What's the lag?
# - Are there errors?
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- **No visibility**: Can't see what's happening
- **Silent failures**: Messages stuck, nobody knows
- **Hard to debug**: No metrics or logs
- **No alerts**: Can't detect problems

**Better Approach:**
```python
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, Gauge

# Metrics
messages_published = Counter('messages_published_total', 'Messages published', ['queue'])
messages_processed = Counter('messages_processed_total', 'Messages processed', ['queue', 'status'])
processing_time = Histogram('message_processing_seconds', 'Processing time')
queue_lag = Gauge('queue_lag_messages', 'Messages waiting', ['queue'])

def create_order(order_data):
    db.insert_order(order_data)
    
    # Publish with metrics
    queue.publish("order.created", order_data)
    messages_published.labels(queue='order.created').inc()
    
    return {"status": "ok"}

def handle_order(message):
    with processing_time.time():
        try:
            data = json.loads(message.body)
            process_order(data)
            message.ack()
            messages_processed.labels(queue='order.created', status='success').inc()
        except Exception as e:
            log.error(f"Failed to process order: {e}")
            messages_processed.labels(queue='order.created', status='error').inc()
            raise

# Monitor queue lag
def update_queue_metrics():
    for queue_name in ['order.created', 'email.send']:
        lag = queue.get_message_count(queue_name)
        queue_lag.labels(queue=queue_name).set(lag)
        
        if lag > 10000:
            alert_team(f"High lag in {queue_name}: {lag} messages")

# Dashboards show:
# - Messages/sec published and processed
# - Processing latency (p50, p95, p99)
# - Queue lag (messages waiting)
# - Error rate
```
